I am Najam Ali Abbas, a passionate programmer who love to solve problems.
I started my programming career with python, python allowed me to focus on problem solving rather focusing on syntax of Programming language.It was an amazing experience.
After that  For object Oriented Programming I used C++ because the basic concepts for OOP can be understood easily.
I started web development as well , I have good grip on Html, CSS and JAvascript. Used Bootstrap as well as made my own website using wrodpress.org.
Currently I am doing my bachelor's Degree, I write blogs on weekly basis about Programming and topics related to technologies.
Want to persue Career in Artificial Iteligence.
You can call me Ctoic(Stoic) ;).
